# Battleship-shared

This is the shared project which contains the shared stuff betweetn client and the server in my Battleship game project.

The game has online gaming, viewing other players' games and scoreboard features. It uses JavaFX for the graphic and basic socket programming for connections.

This was one of my advanced programming course homework assignments and I'll leave it here.
